## About Me

Just the **intern** â€” breaking things, fixing them (sometimes), and asking too many questions.
When I'm not drowning in logs, stack traces, and my own bad ideas, I write (very little) about penetration testing, reverse engineering, and why I probably shouldn't be trusted with production systems.
Check out my [blog](/blog/) for my latest misadventures.
